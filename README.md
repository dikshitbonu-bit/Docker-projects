# Projects

A collection of small projects built in various languages and frameworks. Each project lives in its own folder and is fully self-contained — source code, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml` included, so you can just clone and run.

## Structure

```
/project-name
  ├── src/
  ├── Dockerfile
  └── docker-compose.yml
```

## Usage

```bash
cd project-name
docker compose up
```
